Aviary is an app that lets you interact with a variety of 
large language models (LLMs) in a single place. 
You can compare the outputs of different models directly, rank them by quality,
get a cost and latency estimate, and more. In particular, it offers good support for 
Transformer models hosted on [Hugging Face](http://hf.co) and in many cases also 
supports [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) inference acceleration. 

Aviary is built on top of [Ray](https://ray.io) by [Anyscale](https://anyscale.com).
It's an [open source project](https://github.com/ray-project/aviary), which means
that you can deploy it yourself to a cloud service, 
or simply use our [hosted version](http://aviary.anyscale.com/).
If you would like to use a managed version of Aviary specific to your company,
please [reach out to us](mailto:mwk@anyscale.com).
